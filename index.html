# Canva redirect / proxy

This folder contains two options to make a small site that immediately sends visitors to:

https://thanhtl113.my.canva.site/

1) Static redirect (easy)

- Open `index.html` in a browser or serve it from any static host. It performs an immediate redirect using a meta-refresh and JavaScript fallback.

2) Optional Node.js proxy (keeps your domain in the address bar)

Files:
- `proxy.js` — Express server that proxies requests to the Canva site using `http-proxy-middleware`.
- `package.json` — package manifest with start script.

Run (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd C:\Users\thanh\Downloads
npm install
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 to see the proxied site.

Notes & cautions:
- Proxying third-party websites may violate their terms of service or copyright. Use this only for sites you control or have permission to mirror.
- Some sites block being framed or proxied (CSP, cookies, mixed-content errors). If you see errors, try the simple redirect instead.
- If you run this on a public server, secure the server (HTTPS, rate limits, logging) and be mindful of legal/ethical concerns.
